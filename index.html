        <h2>Project Approach</h2>
        <body>
        Originally, our group was presented with creating an app that would connect coaches with athletes. We were given a clickable prototype of the app and tasked with providing functionality to it. However, soon after we shifted focus towards development of a quizzing platform.<p>
        The new objective was to create a complete program that allows coaches to quiz football players on specific routes and formations. In addition, the program needed to be able to generate animations for the plays in 2D and 3D, allowing the user to view the play from multiple viewpoints and angles.<p>
        Initially, we started programming with the Unity platform. This entailed writing scripts in C#, alongside using the graphical interface provided by Unity to produce the animations. However, a series of problems emerged with this approach. Primarily, Unity, although powerful, had a significant learning curve to get our project to a functional state. Routing the sprites, interacting between menus, and quick loading led us to seek a new approach.<p>
        After voicing some of our concerns, we were introduced to BabylonJS, a JavaScript framework that had the potential to fix many prior issues. From here, we began to develop in strictly BabylonJS, converting the already existing Unity project into JavaScript. The built in functionality and quick testing made this conversion successful.<p>
        Lastly, we finalized the program by using BabylonJS, saved HTML pages that integrated the JavaScript code into a quickly loadable format, and deployed the project to GitHub's hosting service.<p>

        The initial approach was to use Unity to develop our entire platform. However, we determined that the speed, learning curve, and practicality of continuing to rely on Unity would prove to be a hinderance.

        Our final, primary approach was to use the JavaScript platform "BabylonJS", which allowed us to tie together our Quiz, 2D, and 3D functionality into one coherant program. With BabylonJS, we were able to experiment in their provided playground (<a href="url">playground.babylonjs.com</a>). From the playground, we downloaded the playground into individual HTML files, which we finally modified to allow them to pass data and interact via Session Storage.
